title: Variables
descr: |
  Bash uses variables to store data in a handler, which can be inserted into a statement later.

  For storing data, it is important to **not** have any spaces around the equal sign.

  Retrieving (inserting) the data works via the `$`-sign and if in quotes, use double quotes!
code: |
  foo='value one'
  echo "this is $foo"
---
title: Function
descr: |
  A Bash-function takes an arbitrary number of arguments and processes them.

  The example here defines a function `f1` and prints them via `echo`.
  Notice, that missing arguments are more-or-less like an empty string.
code: |
  function f1() {
    echo "$1 $2"
  }
  f1 a b
  f1 foo
