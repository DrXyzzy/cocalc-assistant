title: Data Frame
descr: |
  A `data.frame` is a fundamental and very powerful object in R.
  Two lists `a` and `b` and a sequence `c` (also vector, actually) of same length,
  are combined into a common `data.frame` named `df`.

  For more information: `help(data.frame)`
code: |
  a <- c(1,2,1)
  b <- c("Fred", "Susan", "Joe")
  c <- seq(1, by=.01, length=3)
  df <- data.frame(sex = a, name = b, result = c)
  df
