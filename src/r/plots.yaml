title: Plotting in R
descr: |
  R offers a range of very powerful functions and extension packages for visualizing data.

  Here, we start with one of the simplest plots available: a relationship between two vectors $x$ and $y$ of equal length.
code: |
  # x is a vector from 0 to 10 with 100 elements
  x <- seq(from=0, to=10, length.out=100)
  y <- x * sin(x)
  plot(x, y)
---
title: Stem Plot
descr: |
  A condensed overview of all numbers in a given list as text.
code: |
  stem(rnorm(1000, mean = 5, sd = 10))
---
title: Adjust default size of plots
descr: |
  This **only** works for Sage Worksheets in CoCalc (because of the `%sage`)!
code: |
  %sage r.set_plot_options(height=4, width=10)"
---
title: Histogram Density
code: |
  attach(faithful)
  hist(eruptions, seq(1.6, 5.2, 0.2), prob=TRUE)
  lines(density(eruptions, bw=0.1))
  rug(eruptions)
---
title: QQPlot
code: |
  attach(faithful)
  long <- eruptions[eruptions > 3]
  par(pty="s")   # square figure
  qqnorm(long)
  qqline(long)
---
title: Boxplot
code: |
  a <- rnorm(10)
  b <- rnorm(10, mean=2)
  boxplot(a, b)
---
title: Contour Plot
code: |
  x <- seq(-pi, pi, len=50)
  y <- x
  f <- outer(x, y, function(x, y) cos(y)/(1 + x^2))
  contour(x, y, f, nlevels=15)
