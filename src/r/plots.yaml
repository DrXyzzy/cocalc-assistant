title: Plotting in R
descr: |
  R offers a range of very powerful functions and extension packages for visualizing data.

  Here, we start with one of the simplest plots available: a relationship between two vectors $x$ and $y$ of equal length.
code: |
  # x is a vector from 0 to 10 with 100 elements
  x <- seq(from=0, to=10, length.out=100)
  y <- x * sin(x)
  plot(x, y)
