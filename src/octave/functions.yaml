title: "Linspace"
descr: |
  `linspace` creates a one dimensional (*linear*) array of equally spaced values.

  The `'` tickmark transposes it to a vector, which is the usual form when further using it in a calculation.
code: |
  linspace(-2, 5, 20)'

title: "Meshgrid"
descr: |
  Imagine you want to evaluate a binary function $f(x,\,y) := x + 2 y$.

  For evaluating it in vectorized notation, you need a grid for the cartesian product of all $x$ and $y$.
code: |
  x = 0:3;
  y = 0:4;
  [xx, yy] = meshgrid(x, y);
  xx + 2*yy
