# CoCalc Assistant

A collection of code snippet examples to assist working on CoCalc â†’ [read more](src/README.md).

## Development

The source files are in `/src` and are processed via the `examples.py` Python file.

Usually, just running `make` in the main directory is enough to see if the changes did work.

The output is a unified `examples.json` file, which can be used by other tools -- right now that's [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com).

## Submodule

When used as a **submodule**, one suitable magic git commands to update all submodules is

```
git submodule foreach "git fetch origin; git checkout master; git reset --hard origin/master"
```
