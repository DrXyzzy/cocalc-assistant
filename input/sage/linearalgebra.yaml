title: Vector
descr: |
  Sage is able to build vectors of elements in a ring.
  When no ring is specified, it deduces it from the given elements.

  Look at the different parents of $v_1$ and $v_2$.
code: |
  v1 = vector([1,2,3])
  print(v1)
  print(v1.parent())
  v2 = vector([-1.1, 2.2, 3])
  print(v2)
  print(v2.parent())

title: Matrix
descr: |
  Sage is able to build matrices of elements in a ring.
  Similar to vectors, the ring is deduced from the elements.

  In this case here, we explicitly tell Sage that the ring is `RDF`, though.
code: |
  m1 = matrix([[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m1)
  print(m1.parent())
  m2 = matrix(RDF, [[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m2)
  print(m2.parent())

title: Inverse of a Matrix
descr: |
  You can either all the method `.inverse()` or use the `~` operator.

  Note, that the inverse depends on the ring!
code: |
  m1 = matrix([[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(m1.inverse())
  m2 = matrix(RDF, [[1, 2], [4, -1]])
  print(~m2)
